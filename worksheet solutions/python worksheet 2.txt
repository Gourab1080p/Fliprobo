Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary

Ans - 
List:- It is simplest data structure in Python and is used to store a list of values. Lists are collections of items (strings, integers, or even other lists).Each item in the list has an assigned index value.Lists are enclosed in [ ].
Tuple:- A tuple is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers.The important difference is that tuples are immutable.Lists are enclosed in ( ).
Set:Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed.It is unorderd.
Dictionary:Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.Use {} curly brackets to construct the dictionary, and [] square brackets to index it.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.

Ans- No,strings are immutable in python.

Word = "I+Love+Python"  
print(Word.replace("+", " ")) 

O/P- I Love Python

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.

Ans- The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument.

for eg: ord('A') is 65 which is the ASCII value. 

type(ord('B'))
o/p- int

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0. Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

Ans- 

import cmath  
a = float(input('Enter a: '))  
b = float(input('Enter b: '))  
c = float(input('Enter c: '))  
    
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)    
eq1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
eq2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(eq1,eq2)) 

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input the value of ‘n’.

Ans- 
n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
n * (n+1) / 2
